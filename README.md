# Research Tool

## Overview

The **Research Tool** is designed to assist users in generating tailored content based on a specific topic. By providing the topic, content context, and the number of paragraphs required, the tool dynamically creates a prompt to retrieve the most relevant and structured information. This tool is ideal for researchers, writers, and anyone who needs quick, concise content on a specific subject.

## Features

- **Dynamic Prompt Generation**: Allows users to input a topic, specify the content context, and decide how many paragraphs of content they need.
- **Customizable Output**: Users can customize the type of content they need by specifying context and length, resulting in a personalized output.
- **Flexible Use Cases**: Useful for academic research, content creation, and idea generation.
